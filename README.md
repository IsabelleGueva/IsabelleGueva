- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Isabelle Guevara <br>
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software engineering, Machine Learning, and Data Science. <br>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Flask.<br>
- I want to gain some experience with Machine Learning and Software Engineering through projects and internships. My preferred method of learning is to dive into a project and figure it out as I go along. Then, review code with peers and mentors to refine my technique and planning process. <br>
